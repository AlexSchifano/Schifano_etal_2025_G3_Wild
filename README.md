### DATA PRODUCTION SCRIPTS ###
Scripts used for data production encapsulate all steps used in the study from acquiring data from the CaeNDR database to calling variants, annotate them and adjusting positional information.
They are numbered in order of use.
The file architecture is not created by the scripts.

### DATA ANALYSIS SCRIPTS ###
Those scripts are essentially in R and include all analysis done on the dataset produced by the set of "Data production scripts".
